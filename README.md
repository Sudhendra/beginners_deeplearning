# Beginners_Deeplearning_MachineLearning

A few examples of beginners level deep learning + machine learning image classification.

Contains:
- Binary Classification
- Multiclass Classification
- Examples of Dropout, Normalization, Regularization, Regression
- Data visualization and exploration (VVVV IMP to understand the architecture of the model)


PS:
All examples are structured with keras, tensorflow, sklearn etc. frameworks. 
*Dataset for the examples are not included. Find them on several platforms such as kaggle.* 

::-------------------IMP---------------------::
- The directory must be changed to the respective directory containing the train, test datasets.
- The submisssion is for the Kaggle sets. Feel free to use the code for further improvement and learning.
